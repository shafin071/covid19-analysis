See [HTML version](https://shafin071.github.io/covid19-analysis/) of notebook to see all the visualizations 

## Situation:
A dataset was released for South Korea COVID-19 cases back in February 2020. This was one of the first pandemic related dataset released on Kaggle

## Task:
Exploratory Data Analysis and Time-Series Forecast on [South Korea's COVID-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset) using Python and Statistical Modeling

## Action:
The analysis notebook consists of 5 segments:

1. Patient Analysis
2. Contagion Analysis
3. Confirmed Cases Forecast
4. Accuracy of Confirmed Cases Forecast
5. Update on Confirmed Cases Forecast (as of April 27th, 2020)

## Result:
As of April 27th 2020, the model gave a forecast for confirmed cases in South Korea with a **Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.33%**


### NOTE: 
Since the release, more details may have been added to this dataset in recent months which are not captured in this analysis.
